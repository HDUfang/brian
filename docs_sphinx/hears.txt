Brian hears
===========

Brian hears is the auditory modelling library for Brian. It consists of
classes for defining sounds, filter banks and neuron models. These classes
are designed to be modular and easily extendable. Typically, a model will
consist of a chain starting with a sound which is plugged into a chain of
filter banks, which are then plugged into a neuron model. 

The two main classes in Brian hears are :class:`Sound` and :class:`Filterbank`,
which function very similarly. Each consists of multiple channels (typically
just 1 or 2 in the case of sounds, and many in the case of filterbanks,
but in principle any number of channels is possible for either). The difference
is that a filterbank has an input source, which can be either a sound or
another filterbank.

All scripts using Brian hears should start by importing the Brian and Brian
hears packages as follows::

	from brian import *
	from brian.hears import *

.. seealso:: Reference documentation for :ref:`brian-hears-reference`.

Sounds
------

Sounds can be loaded from a WAV or AIFF file with the :func:`loadsound`
function (and saved with the :func:`savesound` function or :meth:`Sound.save`
method), or by initialising with a filename::

	sound = loadsound('test.wav')
	sound = Sound('test.aif')
	sound.save('test.wav')
	
Various standard types of sounds can also be constructed, e.g. pure tones,
white noise, clicks and silence::

	sound = tone(1*kHz, 1*second)
	sound = whitenoise(1*second)
	sound = click(1*ms)
	sound = silence(1*second)

You can pass a function of time or an array to initialise a sound::

	# Equivalent to Sound.tone
	sound = Sound(lambda t:sin(50*Hz*2*pi*t), duration=1*second)
	
	# Equivalent to Sound.whitenoise
	sound = Sound(randn(int(1*second*44.1*kHz)), samplerate=44.1*kHz)

Multiple channel sounds can be passed as a list or tuple of filenames,
arrays or :class:`Sound` objects::

	sound = Sound(('left.wav', 'right.wav'))
	sound = Sound((randn(44100), randn(44100)), samplerate=44.1*kHz)
	sound = Sound((Sound.tone(1*kHz, 1*second),
	               Sound.tone(2*kHz, 1*second)))
	               
A multi-channel sound is also a numpy array of shape ``(nsamples, nchannels)``,
and can be initialised as this (or converted to a standard numpy array)::

	sound = Sound(randn(44100, 2), samplerate=44.1*kHz)
	arr = array(sound)

Sounds can be added and multiplied::

	sound = Sound.tone(1*kHz, 1*second)+0.1*Sound.whitenoise(1*second)
	
For more details on combining and operating on sounds, including shifting them
in time, repeating them, resampling them, ramping them, finding and setting
intensities, plotting spectrograms, etc., see :class:`Sound`.

Sounds can be played using the :func:`play` function or :meth:`Sound.play` method::

	play(sound)
	sound.play()
	
Sequences of sounds can be played as::

	play(sound1, sound2, sound3)

The number of channels in a sound can be found using the ``nchannels``
attribute, and individual channels can be extracted using the
:meth:`Sound.channel` method, or using the ``left`` and ``right`` attributes
in the case of stereo sounds::

	print sound.nchannels
	print amax(abs(sound.left-sound.channel(0)))

As an example of usage, the following swaps the channels in a stereo sound::

	sound = Sound('test_stereo.wav')
	swappedsound = Sound((sound.right, sound.left))
	swappedsound.play()

Filter chains
-------------

The standard way to set up a model based on filterbanks is to start with a 
sound and then construct a chain of filterbanks that modify it, for example
a common model of cochlear filtering is to apply a bank of gammatone filters,
and then half wave rectify and compress it (for example, with a 1/3 power law).
This can be achieved in Brian hears as follows (for 3000 channels in the
human hearing range from 20 Hz to 20 kHz)::

	cfmin, cfmax, cfN = 20*Hz, 20*kHz, 3000
	cf = erbspace(cfmin, cfmax, cfN)
	sound = Sound('test.wav')
	gfb = GammatoneFilterbank(sound, cf)
	ihc = FunctionFilterbank(gfb, lambda x: clip(x, 0, Inf)**(1.0/3.0))
	
The :func:`erbspace` function constructs an array of centre frequencies on the
ERB scale. The ``GammatoneFilterbak(source, cf)`` class creates a bank
of gammatone filters with inputs coming from ``source`` and the centre
frequencies in the array ``cf``. The ``FunctionFilterbank(source, func)``
creates a bank of filters that applies the given function ``func`` to the inputs
in ``source``.

Filterbanks can be added and multiplied, for example for creating a linear and
nonlinear path, e.g.::

	sum_path_fb = 0.1*linear_path_fb+0.2*nonlinear_path_fb

A filterbank must have an input with either a single channel or an equal number
of channels. In the former case, the single channel is duplicated for each of
the output channels. However, you might want to apply gammatone filters to a
stereo sound, for example, but in this case it's not clear how to duplicate
the channels and you have to specify it explicitly. You do this using
:class:`RestructureFilterbank`. For example, if the input is a stereo sound
with channels LR then you can get an output with channels LLLRRR or LRLRLR
by writing (respectively)::

	fb = RestructureFilterbank(sound, 3)
	fb = RestructureFilterbank(sound, 3, 'interleave')
	
This class can also be used to combine multiple filterbanks into one, either
joining them in series or interleaving them, as follows::

	fb = RestructureFilterbank((source1, source2))
	fb = RestructureFilterbank((source1, source2), type='interleave')
	
In fact, this class has a lot more options, see the reference documentation for
all the details.

Two of the most important generic filterbanks (upon which many of the others
are based) are :class:`LinearFilterbank` and :class:`FIRFilterbank`. The former
is a generic digital filter for FIR and IIR filters. The latter is specifically
for FIR filters. These can be implemented with the former, but the
implementation is optimised using FFTs with the latter (which can often be
hundreds of times faster, particularly for long impulse responses). IIR filter
banks can be designed using :class:`IIRFilterbank` which is based on the
syntax of the ``iirdesign`` scipy function.

Connecting with Brian
---------------------

To create spiking neuron models based on filter chains, you use the
:class:`FilterbankGroup` class. This acts exactly like a standard Brian
:class:`~brian.NeuronGroup` except that you give a source filterbank and choose
a state variable in the target equations for the output of the filterbank.
A simple auditory nerve fibre model would take the inner hair cell model from
earlier, and feed it into a noisy leaky integrate-and-fire model as follows::

	# Inner hair cell model as before
	cfmin, cfmax, cfN = 20*Hz, 20*kHz, 3000
	cf = erbspace(cfmin, cfmax, cfN)
	sound = Sound.whitenoise(100*ms)
	gfb = GammatoneFilterbank(sound, cf)
	ihc = FunctionFilterbank(gfb, lambda x: 3*clip(x, 0, Inf)**(1.0/3.0))
	# Leaky integrate-and-fire model with noise and refractoriness
	eqs = '''
	dv/dt = (I-v)/(1*ms)+0.2*xi*(2/(1*ms))**.5 : 1
	I : 1
	'''
	G = FilterbankGroup(ihc, 'I', eqs, reset=0, threshold=1, refractory=5*ms)
	# Run, and raster plot of the spikes
	M = SpikeMonitor(G)
	run(sound.duration)
	raster_plot(M)
	show()

And here's the output (after 6 seconds of computation on a 2GHz laptop):

Buffering interface
-------------------

The :class:`Sound`, :class:`OnlineSound` and :class:`Filterbank` classes
(and all classes derived from them) all implement the same buffering
mechanism. The purpose of this is to allow for efficient processing of
multiple channels in buffers. Rather than precomputing the application of
filters to all channels (which for large numbers of channels or long sounds
would not fit in memory), we process small chunks at a time. The entire design
of these classes is based on the idea of buffering, as defined by the base
class :class:`Bufferable` (see section :ref:`brian-hears-class-diagram`).
Each class 
has two methods, ``buffer_init()`` to initialise the buffer, and
``buffer_fetch(start, end)`` to fetch the portion of the buffer from samples
with indices from ``start`` to ``end`` (not including ``end`` as standard for
Python). The ``buffer_fetch(start, end)`` method should return a 2D array of
shape ``(end-start, nchannels)`` with the buffered values.

From the user point of view, all you need to do, having set up a chain of
:class:`Sound` and :class:`Filterbank` objects, is to first call
``buffer_init()`` on the final object in the chain (it will initialise the
buffers of all the earlier objects), and then call ``buffer_fetch(start, end)``
repeatedly. If the output of a :class:`Filterbank` is being plugged into a
:class:`FilterbankGroup` object, everything is handled automatically.

To extend :class:`Filterbank`, it is often sufficient just to implement the
``buffer_apply(input)`` method. See the documentation for :class:`Filterbank`
for more details.

Library
-------

Brian hears comes with a package of predefined filter classes to be used as basic blocks by the user. They consit of classes of standard filters used 
in DSP such as generic IIR, Butterworth filters, 2nd order lowpass filters, etc implemented as filterbanks. Also, classes of basic auditory filters
such as gammatones and gammachirps are provided.

.. index:: HRTF

Head-related transfer functions
-------------------------------

You can work with head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) using the three
classes :class:`HRTF` (a single pair of left/right ear HRTFs),
:class:`HRTFSet` (a set of HRTFs, typically for a single individual), and
:class:`HRTFDatabase` (for working with databases of individuals). At the
moment, we have included only one HRTF database, the :class:`IRCAM_LISTEN`
public HRTF database. However, we will add support for the CIPIC and MIT-KEMAR
databases in a subsequent release.

An example of loading the IRCAM database, selecting a subject and plotting
the pair of impulse responses for a particular direction::

	hrtfdb = IRCAM_LISTEN(r'F:\HRTF\IRCAM')
	hrtfset = hrtfdb.load_subject(1002)
	hrtf = hrtfset(azim=30, elev=15)
	plot(hrtf.left)
	plot(hrtf.right)
	show()

:class:`HRTFSet` has a set of coordinates, which can be
accessed via the ``coordinates`` attribute, e.g.::

	print hrtfset.coordinates['azim']
	print hrtfset.coordinates['elev']

You can also generated filterbanks associated either to an :class:`HRTF` or
an entire :class:`HRTFSet`. Here is an example of doing this with the IRCAM
database, and applying this filterbank to some white noise and plotting the
response as an image::

	# Load database
	hrtfdb = IRCAM_LISTEN(r'D:\HRTF\IRCAM')
	hrtfset = hrtfdb.load_subject(1002)
	# Select only the horizontal plane
	hrtfset = hrtfset.subset(lambda elev: elev==0)
	# Set up a filterbank
	sound = whitenoise(10*ms)
	fb = hrtfset.filterbank(sound)
	# Extract the filtered response and plot
	img = fb.buffer_fetch(0, len(sound)).T
	img_left = img[:img.shape[0]/2, :]
	img_right = img[img.shape[0]/2:, :]
	subplot(121)
	imshow(img_left, origin='lower left', aspect='auto',
	       extent=(0, sound.duration/ms, 0, 360))
	xlabel('Time (ms)')
	ylabel('Azimuth')
	title('Left ear')
	subplot(122)
	imshow(img_right, origin='lower left', aspect='auto',
	       extent=(0, sound.duration/ms, 0, 360))
	xlabel('Time (ms)')
	ylabel('Azimuth')
	title('Right ear')
	show()

This generates the following output:

.. image:: images/hrtfset_response_plot.png

:class:`HRTFSet`, :class:`HRTFDatabase` and :class:`IRCAM_LISTEN`.
