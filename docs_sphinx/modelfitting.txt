Model fitting
=============
The modelfitting library allows to fit a neuron model to data. To import the
library, use ::

  from brian.library.modelfitting import *
  
Usage example
-------------
To fit the parameters of a neuron model with respect to some data, use the
``modelfitting`` function ::

  params = modelfitting(model=equations, reset=reset, threshold=threshold,
                               data=data, input=input,
                               tau=[-inf, 30*ms, 60*ms, +inf])

The model is defined by ``equations``, ``reset`` and ``threshold``. The data
is defined by ``data`` (a list of pairs (neuron index, spike time)), and the input
is a list of current values. The input variable should be ``I`` in the equations.
Each parameter of the model is defined by four values ::
  
  param_name = [min, init_min, init_max, max]

``min`` and ``max`` are constraints on the parameter. ``init_min`` and
``init_max`` define the initial interval of the parameter.
The parameters found by the optimization procedure are stored in the Parameter
object ``params``.

Additional parameters are :
* ``input_var`` : The input variable name in the equations ('I' by default)
* ``verbose`` : Set to False for not printing iterations (True by default)
* ``particles`` : Number of particles in the particle swarm algorithm
* ``slices`` : Number of time slices (1 by default)
* ``overlap`` : Overlap in second between time slices (0*ms by default)
* ``iterations`` : Number of iterations in the optimization algorithm (10 by default)
* ``delta`` : Time window for the computation of the gamma precision factor (4*ms by default)
* ``init`` : Initial state values, as a dictionary {state variable=initial value}
