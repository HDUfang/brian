Electrophysiology: electrode compensation
=========================================
The electrophysiology library also contains methods to compensate for the
electrode voltage in single-electrode current clamp recordings.
To import the electrophysiology library::

  from brian.library.electrophysiology import *

There is a series of example scripts in the examples/electrophysiology folder.

Active Electrode Compensation (AEC)
-----------------------------------
The electrophysiology library includes the Active Electrode Compensation (AEC) technique
described in Brette et al (2008),
`High-resolution intracellular recordings using a real-time computational model of the electrode
<http://www.di.ens.fr/~brette/papers/Brette2008Neuron.html>`__,
Neuron 59(3):379-91.

Given a digital current-clamp recording of the (uncompensated) potential ``v``
(vector of values) and injected current ``i``, the following instructions
calculate the full kernel of the system and the electrode kernel::

  K=full_kernel(v,i,ksize)
  Ke=electrode_kernel_soma(K,start_tail)
  
``ksize`` is the size of the full kernel (number of sampling steps; typical size is
about 15 ms) and ``start_tail`` is the size of the electrode kernel (start point
of the ''tail'' of the full kernel; typical size if about 4 ms). The electrode
should be compensated for capacitance (capacitance neutralization)
but not resistance (bridge compensation). The best choice for the
input current is a series of independent random values, and the last ``ksize``
steps of ``v`` should be null (i.e., the injection should stop before the end).
Here it was assumed that the recording was done at the soma; if it is done in a thin
process such as a dendrite or axon, the function ``electrode_kernel_dendrite``
should be used instead. The full kernel can also be obtained from a step current
injection::

  K=full_kernel_from_step(v,i,ksize)
  Ke=electrode_kernel_soma(K,start_tail)

where ``i`` is a constant value in this case (note that this is not the best choice for
real recordings).

Once the electrode kernel has been found, any recording can be compensated as follows::

  vcomp=AEC_compensate(v,i,ke)

where ``v`` is the raw voltage recording, ``i`` is the injected current
and ``ke`` is the electrode kernel.
