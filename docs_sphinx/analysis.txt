Analysis and plotting
=====================

.. index::
	pair: plotting; pylab

Most plotting should be done with the PyLab commands, all of
which are loaded when you import Brian. See:

	http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/matplotlib.pylab.html
	
for help on PyLab. The scientific library `Scipy <http://www.scipy.org>`__ is also automatically
imported by the instruction ``from brian import *``.

The most useful plotting instruction is the Pylab function ``plot``. A typical use with Brian is::

  plot(t/ms,vm/mV)

where t is a vector of times with units ms and vm is a vector of voltage values with units mV.
To display the figures on the screen, the function ``show()`` must be called once (this should be the
last line of your script), except when using IPython with the Pylab mode (``ipython -pylab``).

Brian currently defines just two plotting functions of its own,
:func:`raster_plot` and :func:`hist_plot`.

Raster plots
------------
Spike trains recorded by a :class:`SpikeMonitor` can be displayed as raster plots::

  S=SpikeMonitor(group)
  ...
  raster_plot(S)

Usual options of the ``plot`` command can also be passed to :func:`raster_plot`. One may also pass
several spike monitors as arguments.

Statistics
----------
Here are a few functions to analyse first and second order statistical properties
of spike trains, defined as ordered lists of spike times:

* Firing rate: ``firing_rate(spikes)`` where ``spikes`` is a spike train (list of spike times).
* Coefficient of variation: ``CV(spikes)``.
* Cross-correlogram: ``correlogram(T1,T2,width=20*ms,bin=1*ms,T=None)`` returns
  the cross-correlogram of spike trains T1 and T2 with lag in [-width,width] and given bin size.
  T is the total duration (optional) and should be greater than the duration of T1 and T2.
  The result the rate of coincidences in each bin, returned as an array.
* Autocorrelogram: ``autocorrelogram(T0,width=20*ms,bin=1*ms,T=None)`` is the same as
  ``correlogram(T0,T0,width=20*ms,bin=1*ms,T=None)``.
* Cross-correlation function: ``CCF(T1,T2,width=20*ms,bin=1*ms,T=None)`` returns the cross-correlation
  function of T1 and T2, which is the same as the cross-correlogram divided by the bin size (which makes the
  result independent of the bin size).
* Autocorrelation function: ``ACF(T0,width=20*ms,bin=1*ms,T=None)``, same as
  ``CCF(T0,T0,width=20*ms,bin=1*ms,T=None)``.
* Cross-covariance function: ``CCVF(T1,T2,width=20*ms,bin=1*ms,T=None)`` is the cross-correlation
  function of T1 and T2 minus for the cross-correlation of independent spike trains with the same rates
  (product of rates).
* Auto-covariance function: ``ACVF(T0,width=20*ms,bin=1*ms,T=None)`` is the same as
  ``CCVF(T0,T0,width=20*ms,bin=1*ms,T=None)``.
* Total correlation coefficient: ``total_correlation(T1,T2,width=20*ms,T=None)`` is
  the integral of the cross-covariance function divided by the rate of T1, typically (but not
  always) between 0 and 1.
