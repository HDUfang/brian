
Some of the features of patterned electrical network activity, spontaneously emerging in cultured neuronal networks dissociated from the neocortex, can be replicated by a simple mathematical model of distributed excitability (Giugliano et al., 2004). Disinhibited networks of cortical neurons, cultured over substrate multielectrode arrays, have been intensively studied experimentally in the last years (for a review see Marom and Shahaf, 2002). This script defines a small network of excitatory Integrate-and-Fire model neurons, randomly connected and coupled via current-based Delta-synapses, and incorporating spike-frequency adaptation intrinsic mechanisms, as proposed in Giugliano et al., 2004.

At the end of the simulation, a three panels figure is showed, reporting i) a (simulated) intracellular recording of the membrane potential of a sample neuron of the network (top), ii) a raster plot of the occurrence of spike times across the entire population (middle) and iii) the instantaneous firing rate (bottom, blue) and the temporal evolution of the spike-frequency adaptation variable of a sample neuron (bottom, green).
