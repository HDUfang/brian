Targets
=======
Code is generated for a specific target.
Here is a list of potential targets:

* Python (more precisely, numpy)
* C
* GPU
* Android
	Android is based on linux and uses a Java API.
	But there also seems to be something called Renderscript for numerical
	computation based on a C-like language.

* Cluster or multicores (MPI)
* Spinnaker
* Other neuromorphic chips
* C++ simulator
* Robot (i.e., code to be run on a specific robot)
* PyNN
* PyNeuron
* NineML

What should one do to develop support for a specific target?
* Code generation. Translation to target code could be identical for several targets
  (e.g. that use C or C-like code). Decoration (adding loops etc) is most likely
  target-specific.
* Managing device memory.
* SpikeQueue and possibly a few other key classes.
* Target-specific library. This is code with which the generated will be compiled.
  This is used mostly when creating a complete code.
