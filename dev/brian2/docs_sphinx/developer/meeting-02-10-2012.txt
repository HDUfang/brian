Meeting 02/10/2012
------------------

* BrianObject schedule: get rid of clock.order. Then maybe have a single tuple argument (clock,'start',1)
* Assign automatic unique name to objects. Would be good for code generation and error tracking.
  Several options:
  
	- Numbering: Group1,2 etc
	- Code inspection and choose LHS
	- Name list (animals, bridge names etc)
* Subclass CodeString into Statements and Expression
* CodeString.check_unit_against: other name? (check_units?)
* Stochastic term: enforce numbering xi (xi1, xi2) or indexing (xi_alpha etc) if there are several of them
  So we could have tuples of stochastic terms.
* Have private variables in NeuronGroup for optimisation (ie calculation of coefficients in linear updates).
* Refractoriness implementation:

	- Current Brian method is mathematically wrong with coupled variables.
	- Let's see about the speed of the other options.
	- The "if" idea: maybe if it's reasonably simple.
* To read: Simulation on multiple devices.
* Multiple devices:

	- Maybe let users rewrite NeuronGroup etc for each device.
	- AbstractNeuronGroup as base class
	- Start with two cases: Python and stand-alone C
