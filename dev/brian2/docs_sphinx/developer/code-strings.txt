Code strings
============
A code string is a string that can be evaluated in a namespace. Examples are:

* Right-hand side of equations
* Reset
* Threshold condition
* Synaptic events triggered by pre- and post-synaptic spikes
* Expressions used to assign synaptic variables, or create synapses
* We could also use expressions to assign neuron variables
* Perhaps, state update code

There are two types of code strings:

* Expressions
* Statements

I suggest to create a base class, e.g. ``CodeString``, and two subclasses,
``Expression`` and ``Statement``. Equations would be parsed into sets of
expressions describing the RHS.

These classes should handle:

* Basic string manipulations
* Namespace building
* Units checking (for expressions)
* Possibly, linearity/conditional linearity checking
* Possibly, execution in a namespace
* Possibly, code generation

There two types of contexts: ``NeuronGroup`` and ``Synapses``.
This determines how the code is evaluated, and how variable names are resolved.

* i, j
* t, dt
* xi
* function names: sin, cos, etc., maybe also rand(), randn(), etc.
