Simulation on devices
=====================
Code can be generated for different targets, e.g. C or GPU.
This means that code will be executed in different languages, but also that
memory can be stored on a external device. This would be the case of simulation
on GPU, clusters or neuromorphic devices.

In this case, arrays for NeuronGroup and Synapses should not be create on the
host but on the device. The host would only store the address on the device.
The simplest way to handle this, I think, is to have a special class
array_on_device.

We should also consider that a number of variables would probably also need
to be stored on the device (for example, time of last spike)
When we create any variable, we need to keep in mind that the device may need
to access it.

What needs to be done is to distinguish clearly between variables and objects
that are specific to Brian cooking, or needed for it (e.g. model specification,
network structure, etc), and simulation variables, which can potentially all
be on the device.
Among simulation variables, some may only need to be in the code (constant
variables, e.g. number of neurons in a group), others require a creation in
device memory.

So I suggest that, from the start, we clearly categorize all variables as
being device variables, constant variables, structural variables
(basically whether the device needs to know about it).
