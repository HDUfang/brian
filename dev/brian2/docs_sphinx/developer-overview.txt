Overview of Brian 2.0
=====================

The aims of Brian 2.0 are:
* To simplify the structure, including getting rid of a number of classes. In particular,
  the Synapses class will replace Connection, STP and STDP.
* To refactor a number of things, in particular dealing with models defined in strings.
* To make it easier for other people to contribute, by making the structure more modular.
* To develop target-specific implementations (Python, C, GPU...).

To achieve these goals, Brian 2.0 will rely more systematically on code generation, where
the code will depend on the target.
There are three types of code:
* state update code, defined by equations
* threshold code, defined as a boolean condition
* reset code, defined as a series of statements

These are used both in NeuronGroup and Synapses.
In fact reset could be more generally defined as an event.
