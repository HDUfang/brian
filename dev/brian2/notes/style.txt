Style and coding guidelines for Brian 2.0
-----------------------------------------
* no relative imports
	[Dan] What does this mean exactly? It is quite restrictive to not allow
  		  for example, package A.B to refer to A.C.
* no wildcard imports
	[Dan] Are we sure about this?
* tests

[Marcel]
In addition to the import-related things we agreed on, I'd like to suggest that
we start thinking a bit about Python 3. Not that Brian 2 should already be
compatible (of the Brian dependencies, matplotlib is not yet there) but that we
use certain constructs or do "from __future__ import" that will make it easier
in the future to do the transition (that means we will lose python 2.5 support
but I think we already agreed on that). For example: Instead of writing
    except Exception, ex:
write
    except Exception as ex:
or use from __future__ import division
so that 3 / 2 returns 1.5 not 1 (3 // 2 would be used for flooring division).
There's a great online book with hints and best
practices (http://python3porting.com/), I could write a bit about that in the
developer guidelines.
