* STDP should allow for parameters in equations, not just DEs (currently
  raises LinAlgError). Also, should be able to access STDP variables
  directly somehow - currently not possible. Ideally, this would be via
  the STDP object, e.g. stdp.A_pre, etc.

* library.ionic_currents: might not work if units are off (looks for amp to recognize the current)
* eqs = MembraneEquation(C=200*pF) + leak + K_current + Na_current
works, but not eqs = leak + K_current + Na_current + MembraneEquation(C=200*pF).
Solution: have a new class that is a set of currents, or (easier) use a new variable with the sum of currents.

* Better progress reporting: the estimated time should adapt, maybe use only the last few seconds rather the entire simulation.
* Check that StringReset and StringThreshold etc. work correctly with e.g. (v>1)&(w>1), see
  bug found by Mark Orphanides 20 June 2009
* Make sure that EmpiricalThreshold and others work correctly with state variables defined
  by equations as well as those defined by differential equations and aliases, a lot of
  them probably assume that it is an element of group._S (this is particularly tricky for
  the C++ compiled versions).

(* Modulation keyword with variables defined as functions)

* Some problem with adding equations together using the same equation more than
  once, e.g. something like (not tested):
    eqs_base = Equations('...')
    eqs_additional_1 = Equations('...')
    eqs_additional_2 = Equations('...')
    eqs_1 = eqs_base+eqs_additional_1
    eqs_2 = eqs_base+eqs_additional_2

* Clean NeuronGroup init, in particular S0 is strangely handled; remove the
init keyword? (in fact S0 is used mostly for unit checking)
(* Neuron = NeuronGroup(1,..))
(* Unit checking in string resets and thresholds)

(* Change default values of compile and freeze to true in NeuronGroup? 
[I would say no, it is less reliable])

(* Cluster computing)
Idea: use pypar, it seems really simple to use
http://datamining.anu.edu.au/~ole/pypar/

(* Compound linear/nonlinear state updaters?)
For example, often there is a linear and nonlinear part of the equation,
e.g. dv/dt is nonlinear, but you have some auxiliary variables to define
an alpha synapse that can be considered separately and are linear.

(* Better LinearStateUpdater)
In most cases, the update matrix is degenerate only because of the parameters.
It would be better to take care of this directly (separate dynamical variables
and parameters, and calculate the matrix).
Other thing: use A**100 instead of 100 time steps.

(* Add MultiLinearStateUpdater to Brian)
Need to decide what the syntax should be, e.g. could have specification of constant
parameters in the Equations, e.g.
eqs = '''
dV/dt = -V/tau : volt
const tau : second
'''
At first this would only be used by MultiLinearStateUpdater
but in principle could also be used by nonlinear mechanisms for better optimisation.

(* refractory can be a vector)
refractory shouldn't have to be a constant for the group.

(* Why is t a vector?)
Figure out why group.t is a vector. It might have to do with units.

(* Turning off magic? )

(* Finish autocorrelogram object )

(* Use the GPU: complete project with TechX to use GPU accelerated versions of code.)
(* Meaningful error messages: Improve catching of errors and usefulness of error messages,
   also look into logging which is very inconsistent at the moment.)
