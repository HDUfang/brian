Next releases
=============
Version 1.3.1
-------------
Initial deadline: 10 November
	[DONE] * Brian examples for our papers [add: pi-limit]
	* New SpikeGeneratorGroup: tests
		- check syntax
		- test speed
		- test bugs
	* Metrics: syntax/tests/examples
		- we need a list of those
	* Brian Hears updates (Tan/Carney)
		- do we need tests? (against their papers/code?)
	* More docs (see Brian meeting 25 Oct 2011)
	[DONE] * Bug fixes added by Marcel (put in new_features.txt)
	* Trace analysis library (new electrophysiology library package)
		[DONE] - docs
		[DONE] - update our own scripts to use this library instead of the experimental code
		[DONE] - remove functions taken from experimental/trace_analysis
		[DONE] - examples (examples/electrophysiology)
		- are there other functions we might want to insert? (some used to process Anna's traces?)
	* PoissonInputs: docs and syntax
	* Maybe: Sompolinsky example? (if it doesn't require a sound database)
	* What is the state of the experimental neuromorphic module, anything stable there?
	* Check all new features (see svn history) and add in new_features.txt

Version 1.4
-----------
Initial deadline: January
	* Examples from the twister
	* New model fitting
	* MultiLinear...
	* Refractoriness
	* Victor's spatializer: syntax

SpikeGeneratorGroup
-------------------
Old one is in DirectControl. Slow for many spikes.
New one is in experimental/neuromorphic/AER and works for fixed arrays of spikes (not iterators).

* Write NewSpikeGeneratorGroup
* Have new threshold (FastDC???) and choose at init time depending on argument type
* [Marcel] Tests and make sure it works and is fast enough!
* Docs
* FastDCThreshold: other name?
* AERSpikeMonitor -> in main distribution

(* Syntax that combines MultipleGG and the basic one? (using MultipleSpikeGeneratorThreshold))
(* Add SpikeMonitor.save?)

Tests: in tests/testinterface/test_directcontrol
and neuromorphic/test_AERSpikeMonitor.py
