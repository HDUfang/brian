TODO (Synapses)
---------------
* Faster queue: C version of propagate or insert?
* pre/post code should include rand()
* Have the option to precompute offsets at run time
	perhaps precompute unless it produces a memory error
* setattr (S.w=...)
* State updates and event-driven stuff
* Max delay should be calculated at run time (in SpikeQueue)
* Replace spike queue data with a dynamic array object?
* Replace NeuronGroup.__init__ with own stuff
* assignment of strings (S.w[P,Q]='...')
* state updater
* generate post code
* include static variables in pre/post code
* have a list of variable names
* deal with suffixes (v_post, v_pre)
* have lastupdate, t
* S[:,:]='i<j'
* S[:,:]=array (boolean or int)
* generate synapses_post from postsynaptic
* S.connect_random: fixed number of presynaptic neurons
* S.connect_one_to_one
* Update: Have namespaces partially built at run time (call state_(var)),
  or better, extract synaptic events from the synaptic state matrix;
  same stuff for postsynaptic variables
* Update: execute post code
* Update: insert rand()
* Postsynaptic queues
* S[2,3:5]=(2,3) # 2 synapses from 2 to 3, 3 from 2 to 4
* S[group1,group2]='rand()<0.2' # careful this is highly inefficient
* Automatically check if synapses_post is needed
* StateMonitor
