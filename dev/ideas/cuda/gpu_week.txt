GPU week - Debriefing
=====================

What we have now:
* a NemoConnection that can run a (non plastic) DelayConnection on Nemo.
* a synfire chain example with heterogeneous delays for tests.

What we would like to have:
* the Synapses class on GPU
	This requires 1) backward spike delivery, 2) execution of user code on multiple synaptic variables.
* a complete NeuronGroup on GPU (with threshold)
	For this we can reuse some of Nemo's code.

* Automatic synapse indexing: see the corresponding document. This would be needed to optimize
global memory transfers for both the forward and backward spike propagation (for STDP)

	(if it's worth it perhaps we could think of a GPU algorithm?)

* How to directly construct networks on GPU (could be important in some cases)

NeuronGroup on GPU
------------------
* Threshold/compaction
* New refractory system
* Stochastic equations
* Poisson groups

Synapses
--------
* Finish the Synapses class (Python)
	> Romain

Other things
------------
* Brian Hears
* Check other algorithms in the literature (especially for STDP) (e.g. Jayram's)
* We have Issam's code the di svn (Brian/Issam_BrianToCuda)
