GPU week - management
=====================
To start with:
* Try to have Nemo running with Brian GPU groups
* Try to have a Brian script running with Nemo's scatter-gather operations

How about running a Jeffress model? (has many heterogeneous delays)

Targets:
* A complete NeuronGroup on GPU (with threshold)
* A DelayConnection on GPU (could call Nemo behind the scenes, but then we need to get rid of Boost)

Things we need to discuss
-------------------------
* How to do STDP with traces. Ideally, this should be integrated in the new Synapse class.
* How to directly construct networks
* How to access all variables (monitors)

Things that could be done later
-------------------------------
* Stochastic equations
* New refractory system
* Brian Hears

Things that could be done in parallel
-------------------------------------
* The SpikeQueue and Synapses classes in Python
