Algorithmic issues
==================
NeuronGroup
-----------
The main issue is compaction.

Synapses
--------
The main issue is probably coalescence.
Consider two connected groups of neurons P and Q, with p synapses per neuron on average.

Let us first consider forward propagation with various conduction delays.
When a spike is produced by presynaptic neuron i, the spike reaches p synaptic targets,
at different times. These spikes will then affect synaptic variables, or postsynaptic
variables.
We consider that these variables are instantly modified (i.e., no buffering).
At any given time step, we have to consider a set of incoming spikes from different neurons.
Assuming that different neurons fire independently, variables
corresponding to different presynaptic neurons must be considered as non
contiguous. Therefore, it is enough to examine the case of spikes coming from a single
presynaptic neuron. Synapses
