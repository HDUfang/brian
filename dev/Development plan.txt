Brian Development plan
----------------------

How about we launch a survey? We can easily create a web form with google, and
have questions about what users would like to see in next versions.

1) GPU
------
* Start with Brian Hears. Essentially, GPU kernels are done but we need
to remove all GPU<->CPU transfers. Ideally, we would just transfer spikes
(and so it would be good if neuron groups can include noise/Poisson firing).
* For Brian: maybe have a first version that is not entirely transparent to
the user?

2) Synapses:
------------
Currently missing:
* nonlinear synapses (NMDA)
* probabilistic synapses - implications for STP/STDP
* multiple synapses (with different delays) between the same pre/post neurons
* STDP: access to postsynaptic variables
* STDP: rules with local synaptic variables 

First, we should at least provide a way, even not clean and elegant, to implement
these things. Then essentially what will be needed is: 1) local synaptic variables
(distinct from weights), 2) event-driven synaptic dynamics (taken delays into
account).

3) Miscellaneous
----------------
* Refractoriness
* Cyrille's new LinearStateUpdater code
* Stochastic DE integrators
* Compound integrators (linear/nonlinear parts)
* Multilinear state updater (new syntax for Equations)
* Code generation
* Cluster simulations
* Cable equations (a lot is done, but we need to implement the integration method)

4) Examples and docs
--------------------
* More examples from our papers.
* Examples from papers should also be posted in modeldb.
* Examples using Playdoh.
* Electrode compensation example.
