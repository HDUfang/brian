BEP-21-Synaptic dynamics

Abstract:
	Currently, synaptic dynamics are only handled at the pre or post-synaptic
	neuron, rather than at the local synapse. For example, for a given
	postsynaptic neuron, there is a single
	equation for all synapses with the same dynamics (e.g. AMPA excitatory
	current) and all presynaptic spikes impact the same variable. In STDP,
	synaptic variables are considered as either presynaptic or postsynaptic,
	not specific of each synapse.
	This design implies strong constraint on synaptic models (kinetics
	and plasticity).
	This BEP aims at overcoming these limitations.

Missing features and a few ideas
================================
* Nonlinear synapses (e.g. NMDA). These require one conductance variable per
  synapse, and separate dynamics.
  We could use a fake NeuronGroup as a proxy to synaptic weights + state updater.
  We could use a slower clock to speed up the simulation.
  Issues: 1) several synaptic variables, 2) heterogeneous delays.
	using a slower clocks?
	(then we can define differential equations on synaptic weights)

* Probabilistic synapses.
  The main difficulty here is to integrate it with STP and STDP.

* Multiple synapses (with different delays) between the same pre/post neurons
  This is almost done, except we need to check if it works with STDP.
  We also need to think of a nice syntax.
	
* STDP: access to postsynaptic variables
  This is probably not a major problem (and can be done with the current version,
  although not in an elegant way), unless it is coupled with local synaptic
  variables.

* STDP: rules with local synaptic variables
  Here we need event-driven dynamics. But one issue is dealing with heterogeneous
  delays. We should start with an existing example (STDP1/2).

The main technical difficulty, I think, is dealing with heterogeneous delays.
