New features since 1.2.1
------------------------

Improvements

* Speed improvement for pure Python version of sparse matrix preparation
* Speed improvements for spike propagation weave code (50-100% faster).

Bug fixes

* Equations/aliases now work correctly in STDP (ticket #56)
* Bug in sparse matrices introduced in scipy 0.8.0 fixed

New features since 1.2.0
------------------------

Major features:

* New remote controlling of running Brian scripts via RemoteControlServer
  and RemoteControlClient.
  
Minor features:

* New module tools.io
* weight and sparseness can now both be functions in connect_random
* New StateHistogramMonitor object
* clear now has a new keyword all which allows you to destroy all Brian
  objects regardless of whether or not they would be found by MagicNetwork.
  In addition, garbage collection is called after a clear.
* New method StateMonitor.insert_spikes to have spikes on voltage traces.

Improvements

* The sparseness keyword in connect_random can be a function
* Added 'wmin' to STDP
* You can now access STDP internal variables, e.g. stdp.A_pre, and monitor
  them by doing e.g. StateMonitor(stdp.pre_group, 'A_pre')
* STDP now supports nonlinear equations and parameters
* refractory can now be a vector (see docstring for NeuronGroup) for constant
  resets.
* modelfitting now uses playdoh library
* C++ compiled code is now much faster thanks to adding -ffast-math switch to
  gcc, and there is an option which allows you to set your own
  compiler switches, for example -march=native on gcc 4.2+.
* SpikeGeneratorGroup now has a spiketimes attribute to reset the list of
  spike times.
* StateMonitor now caches values in an array, improving speed for M[i] operation
  and resolving ticket #53
* clear() now does a garbage collection after clearing, making memory buildups
  less likely on repeated runs

Bug fixes

* Sparse matrices with some versions of scipy
* Weave now works on 64 bit platforms with 64 bit Python
* Fixed bug introduced in 1.2.0 where dense DelayConnection structures would
  not propagate any spikes
* Fixed bug where connect* functions on DelayConnection didn't work with
  subgroups but only with the whole group.
* Fixed bug with linked_var from subgroups not working
* Fixed bug with adding Equations objects together using a shared base equation
  (ticket #9 on the trac)
* unit_checking=False now works (didn't do anything before)
* Fixed bug with using Equations object twice (for two different NeuronGroups)
* Fixed unit checking bug and ZeroDivisionError (ticket #38)
* Fixed rare problems with spikes being lost due to wrong size of SpikeContainer,
  it now dynamically adapts to the number of spikes.
* Fixed ticket #5, ionic_currents did not work with units off
* Fixed ticket #6, Current+MembraneEquation now works
* Fixed bug in modelfitting : the fitness was not computed right with CPUs.
* Fixed bug in modelfitting with random seeds on Unix systems. 
* brian.hears.filtering now works correctly on 64 bit systems

Removed features

* Model has now been removed from Brian (it was deprecated in 1.1).
