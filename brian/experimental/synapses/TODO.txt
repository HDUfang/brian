TODO (Synapses)
---------------
* faster S.w[:,i] (more generally, when 1 argument is :)
	in general, faster synapse_indexes()
* More docstrings
* Synapses.compress(): have the Network object call it for all objects that have it?
* accelerate Synapses.generate_code() (.any())
* S[P,Q]='...' : with subgroups, shift the values of i,j
* S[:,:]='i<j' : int
* compress: perhaps replace dynamic arrays by arrays
* SynapticVariable: should be usable as a numpy array
* deal with suffixes (v_post, v_pre)
* Synapses.generate_code: check if postsynaptic variables are modified
* More careful namespace creation in Synapses.update()(see reset/threshold)
* SpikeQueue callback (to Synapses): this way the clock is only for state updates
* Bound checks in setitem/getitem
* Factor things in code generation
* Faster queue: C version of propagate or insert?
* Faster Synapses.update()
* Synapses with same underlying data (synaptic variables) as another Synapses object (for delayed STDP)
* State updates and event-driven stuff
* Replace spike queue data with a dynamic array object?
* Replace NeuronGroup.__init__ with own stuff
* include static variables in pre/post code
* have a list of variable names
* S[:,:]=array or sequence (boolean or int)
* S.connect_random: fixed number of presynaptic neurons
* S.connect_one_to_one (or 'i==j')
* Update: Have namespaces partially built at run time (call state_(var)),
  or better, extract synaptic events from the synaptic state matrix;
  same stuff for postsynaptic variables
* StateMonitor (already works with synapse indexes):
	what is needed is handling more general indexes in SynapticVariable
	(e.g. lists of tuples)
