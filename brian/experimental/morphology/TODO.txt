TODO
----
* Test with Neuron: use PyNeuron on linux (Dodge & Cooley?)
* Insert Remy's code (especially domain decomposition to deal with branches)
* Cm should be (optionally) a distributed variable (for myeline). It could be done simply by a check
that Cm is in the equations (if Cm=None, then we use the distributed variable).
* Write examples, including point processes
* Think about point processes. Use the Synapses object?
* Morphology: adding morphologies (at least cylinders)?
* One thing is missing the Morphology: the position of the current branch in the
  big matrix (Note: all other variables, length etc, are views on the big matrix,
  for the current branch).
 * GPU
