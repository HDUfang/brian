Notes about Brian hears
=======================
(from reading the docs)

Generally : are all attributes named? (they should be; e.g. tone(frequency=1*kHz)).
Some missing docs (HRTFs, OnlineSound, library models).
How about GPU support?

Sounds
------
Is there a default samplerate? (which could be 1/dt).
Sound.tone -> tone?
Whatâ€™s the default level? (and its units)
play(sound)?
Some missing docs (corresponding to "For more details").

Filter chains
-------------
What do you do if you want to change the input sound?

Random notes
------------
Could we have a dB object?
i.e., 10*dB = 2
and we overload multiplication on the left to make it behave as it should
(that is:x*dB = dB**x)
So could write:
sum_path_fb = (5*dB)*linear_path_fb+(-3*dB)*nonlinear_path_fb
