at intensity does not work

problem with atintensity

problem with sound=sound.smth()  --> not implemented

have a nicer interface than
gammatone.buffer_init()
gt_mon=gammatone.buffer_fetch(0, len(sound))
like gammatone.apply()

add self.filt_a flit_b for every filter for, e.g., further plotting (TODO)
actually it is done in linearfilterbank

cascade??

FunctionFilterbank should hstack automatically drnl linear gain
tile(center_frequencies,(len(sound),1)).shape
should be able to take sound and give N channel

in drnl  RestructureFilterbank is not faster than bank parralel filter

TODO  raise ValueError('Can only automatically duplicate source channels for mono sources, use RestructureFilterbank.')
TODO write better c code (pointer)

if loop over fetch, the result is shifted by one sample compared to the direct (see test_shift) (WRONG)

is it not that the control advance one sample pGc which in turn is used for signal-> lag


handle case when change_interval is not a multiple of the buffer length

TODO change gammachirp as the cascade of the two filters
