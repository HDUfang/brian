Functions
---------

Setting and getting global preferences is done with the following
functions:

.. autofunction:: set_global_preferences
.. autofunction:: get_global_preference

The currently known global preferences are:

.. INSERT_GLOBAL_PREFERENCES_HERE


Global preferences for Brian
----------------------------

The following global preferences have been defined:

``defaultclock = Clock(dt=0.1*msecond)``
    The default clock to use if none is provided or defined
    in any enclosing scope.
``useweave_linear_diffeq = False``
    Whether to use weave C++ acceleration for the solution
    of linear differential equations. Note that on some
    platforms, typically older ones, this is faster and on
    some platforms, typically new ones, this is actually
    slower.
``useweave = False``
    Defines whether or not functions should use inlined compiled
    C code where defined. Requires a compatible C++ compiler.
    The ``gcc`` and ``g++`` compilers are probably the easiest
    option (use Cygwin on Windows machines). See also the
    ``weavecompiler`` global preference.
``weavecompiler = gcc``
    Defines the compiler to use for weave compilation. On Windows machines, installing
    Cygwin is the easiest way to get access to the gcc compiler.
``magic_useframes = True``
    Defines whether or not the magic functions should search
    for objects defined only in the calling frame or if they
    should find all objects defined in any frame. This should
    be set to ``False`` if you are using Brian from an interactive
    shell like IDLE or IPython where each command has its own
    frame, otherwise set it to ``True``.
