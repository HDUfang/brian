These examples demonstrate the new (experimental) Synapses class, which
comes as a replacement of Connection, STDP and STP with many new possibilities,
such as:
* nonlinear synapses
* gap junctions
* arbitrary STDP rules
* probabilistic synapses
* multiple synapses for a given neuron pair

The syntax is described in BEP-21 (dev/BEPS/) and in the docstrings.
The code is in experimental/synapses.
